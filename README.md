# Stack Processor Emulator

## Overview

The processor operates using a minimalist one-character instruction set and relies on a stack of symbol lists for all computations and data manipulation. This emulator was implemented from scratch under strict constraints, such as avoiding standard libraries, limiting loop usage, and emphasizing recursion and custom data structures.

---

## Features

- Symbolic list-based stack handling
- ASCII manipulation and character I/O
- Conditional control flow and pointer-based jumps
- Stack printing for debug/output verification

---

## Instruction Set

Each instruction is a single character. A full list of supported instructions includes:

| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `'` | Push an empty list onto the stack |
| `,` | Pop a list from the stack |
| `:` | Duplicate the top list |
| `;` | Swap the top two lists |
| `@` | Copy list at position A to the top |
| `.` | Read character from input, prepend to top list |
| `>` | Write first character of top list to output, then pop it |
| `!` | Logical NOT on the top list |
| `<` | Compare numbers: push 1 if B < A else 0 |
| `=` | Compare numbers: push 1 if B = A else 0 |
| `~` | Push current instruction pointer value |
| `?` | Conditional jump to T if list W is truthy |
| `-` | Toggle minus sign at end of top list |
| `^` | Remove minus sign (absolute value) |
| `$` | Detach first character from top list and push as new list |
| `#` | Append list A to end of top list |
| `+` | Pop two numbers A and B, push A + B |
| `&` | Print full stack in formatted output |
| `]` | Push character with ASCII code A |
| `[` | Push ASCII code of first character from list A |
| _All other characters_ | Appended to top list |

## Input and Output

- **Input:**
  - Line 1: A program (sequence of characters representing instructions)
  - Line 2: A string representing standard input for the program

- **Output:**
  - Output generated by the `>` and `&` instructions

---

## Constraints

- No use of STL containers except for I/O
- Arrays only allowed for input and program storage
- Only recursion allowed in the code
- Program length and input size are limited to 20,000 characters each

---

## Build and Run

This emulator is implemented in C++. You can compile and run it with:

```bash
g++ stackProcessor.cpp -o stackProcessor.exe
```

---

## Example

**Program**

```
'1234-:
```

**Explanation:**

- `'` creates an empty list  
- `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `-` are appended to the top list (resulting in `4321-`)  
- `:` duplicates the list

**Stack Result:**

```
1: 4321-
0: 4321-
```
